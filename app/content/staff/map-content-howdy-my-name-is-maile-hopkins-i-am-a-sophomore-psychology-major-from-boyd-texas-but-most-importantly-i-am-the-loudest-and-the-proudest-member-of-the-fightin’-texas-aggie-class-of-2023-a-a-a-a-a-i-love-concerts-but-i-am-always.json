I am a sophomore psychology major from Boyd, Texas, but most importantly I am THE LOUDEST and THE PROUDEST member of the Fightin’ Texas Aggie class of 2023!!! A-A-A-A-A! I love concerts but I am always down for a good Netflix binge. I am a first generation Aggie and can’t wait to experience all of the traditions I love so much with all of you! I can’t wait to meet y’all and hope you love FEAST just as much as I do!",
