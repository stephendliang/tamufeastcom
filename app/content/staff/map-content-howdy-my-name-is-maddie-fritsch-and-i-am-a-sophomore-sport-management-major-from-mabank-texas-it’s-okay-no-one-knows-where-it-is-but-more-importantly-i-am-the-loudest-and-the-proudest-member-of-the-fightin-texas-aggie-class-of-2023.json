  "content": "Howdy my name is Maddie Fritsch and I am a sophomore sport management major from Mabank, Texas (it’s okay no one knows where it is) but more importantly I am THE loudest and THE proudest member of the fightin Texas Aggie class of 2023 (A-A-A-A-A). Most of the time you’ll either catch me obsessing over Klay Thompson, taking my daily nap, or listening to One Direction. I am also a first generation Aggie so FEAST really helped me learn all of the fun traditions that A&M has to offer, and I CANT WAIT to share them with the class of 2024!!!",
