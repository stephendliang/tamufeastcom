More importantly, I am THE loudest and THE proudest member of the Fightin’ Texas Aggie Class of 2023… A-A-A-A-A! I was a fish camp counselor for Session E Yellow Camp Richter and got my “Summer” nickname as fish at camp my freshman year. I’m so excited to be a loud & proud co-chair of the Promo Committee this year, and can’t wait to see what the Class of 2024 brings to the table!",
