My name is Emily Guerrero and I am a sophomore Political Science major and Sociology minor from Mission, Texas; BUT more importantly I am the LOUDEST and the PROUDEST member of the Fightin Texas Aggie Class of 2023, A-A-A-A! I love watching football games and sweet tea. I was once voted Most Spirited, and I love all things Aggie spirit! Coincidence? I think not! I can not wait to meet and grow alongside the class of 2024! Thanks and gig em!!",
