I was a Fish Camp counselor for Session G Aqua Camp Samson and in my free time I like to stir the pot and argue about the most random sports takes. Catch me anytime of the day grinding Chem in Evans, Attending the most random of sporting events, or just chilling with friends I met through FEAST. I cannot wait to meet the class of 2024 and help y’all transition to the best 4 years of y’alls lives!",
