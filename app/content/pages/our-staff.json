I’m Ella Sanders and I am a sophomore Allied Health major from Dallas, Texas, but most importantly I am the loudest and the proudest member of the fighting Texas Aggie Class of 2026 (A-A-A-A-A)! In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, doing arts and crafts, and watching football. My favorite Texas A&M tradition is the 12th Man, because they create an incredible energy around campus, and especially at sporting events.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n</div>\n\n![]()\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"bio\">\n<div class=\"paragr\">\n\n## David Rose - Fundraising\n\n</div>\n\n![]()\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"bio\">\n<div class=\"paragr\">\n\n## L﻿andry Langley - Leadership\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\nHowdy!

My name is Oliver Kennedy and I am an industrial distribution major from Sugar Land, TX. But most importantly I am the loudest and the proudest member of the fighting texas aggie class of 2026 A-A-A-A-A! In my free time I enjoy fishing, participating in intramurals, playing basketball at the rec, and watching all the A&M sporting events. My favorite A&M tradition is aggie muster and how we honor all the aggies who have passed away within the past year. I find it meaningful how we remember all of our aggies graduated or not.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n</div>\n\n![]()\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"bio\">\n<div class=\"paragr\">\n\n## G﻿race Le - Outreach\n\n</div>\n\n![]()\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"bio\">\n<div class=\"paragr\">\n\n## Tyler Yates - Outreach\n\n<!--StartFragment-->\n\nHowdy, my name is Tyler Yates and I am a Sophomore Civil Engineering major from Missouri City, Texas, but most importantly I am the loudest and proudest member of the Fighting Texas Aggie Class of 2026.
