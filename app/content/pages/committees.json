Our names are Evan Lee and Kenna Zeller and we are so so so incredibly excited and grateful for the chance to be the Sleag Co-Chairs for the Class of ‘27. Although, more importantly we are the loudest and the proudest members of the fighting Texas Aggie Class of ‘26 A-A-A-A-A!  We will be in charge of street cleanups, service retreat, and planning a philanthropy event in the spring. We can't wait to create meaningful friendships with the Class of ‘27 through acts of service. This year we hope to give freshmen the opportunity to be involved in Aggie tradition as well as help them find their place at A&M!\n\n<!--EndFragment-->\n\n</div>\n\n![]()\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"bio\">\n<div class=\"paragr\">\n\n## Leadership\n\n</div>\n\n![]()\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"bio\">\n<div class=\"paragr\">\n\n## 12th Man\n\n</div>\n\n![]()\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"bio\">\n<div class=\"paragr\">\n\n## Outreach\n\n</div>\n\n![]()\n\n</div>"
