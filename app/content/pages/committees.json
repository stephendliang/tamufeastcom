With that being said, we will leave you with a quote from a famous prophet, Dominique Jones, aka Lil Baby: “Drip or drown, but we know how to swim.” \n\n\n</div>\n\n![](/images/uploads/renderedimage.jpeg)\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"bio\">\n<div class=\"paragr\">\n\n\n## Service League\n\nHowdy! Our names are Sydney and Logan and we are the Service League committee (SLEAG if you’re cool). We are in charge of FEAST’s philanthropy and service events. Last year we adopted a street (peep University drive east), and worked a fun run for charity. We can’t wait to meet the class of 2025. We’re making SLEAG cool again in 2021 so Rush SLEAG.\n\n</div>\n\n![](/images/uploads/renderedimage.jpeg)\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"bio\">\n<div class=\"paragr\">\n\n\n## Leadership\n\nHowdy!
